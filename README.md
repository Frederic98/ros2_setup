# Ros2Setup

This project is a tiny python library made for ROS2 modules to simplify the packaging process.
Instead of having two files -`setup.py` and `package.xml`- with the same duplicated information, this module makes it easy dynamically import the information from the `package.xml` into the python setup file.
